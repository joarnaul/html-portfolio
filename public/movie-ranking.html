<h1> The Best Movies According to Jojo</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite movie because it displays bravery and honor and the ultimate<br>
sacrifice for a higher purpose. An unselfish purpose.
</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This movie is entertaining from begining to end with the most<br>
interresting was to unfold a story.</p>
<h3>Heat</h3>
<p>Don't attach yourself to anything you cannot walk out on in<br>
5 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner.</p>
